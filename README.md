## About

This project is created in a need to understand CSS Layouts and writing it properly. I use SMACSS as the principle in developing this project.

I realise that this project may not reflect SMACSS' true intention. But I've tried my best to follow the SMACSS' guidance and some tips from a couple of resources. So, if you've found my implementation to be incorrect, I would be very honored if you'd open a discussion on this project issue's page. A pull request would be very awesome too.

## Target

The target of this project is to replicate Google Keep's layout.

## Development Requirements

1. NodeJS
2. Gulp: `npm -g install gulp`
3. Dependencies: `npm install --dev`

To build the project, run this command:

> gulp
